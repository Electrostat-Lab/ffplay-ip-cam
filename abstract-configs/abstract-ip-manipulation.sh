# grep is a command used to search for patterns in text.
# -o means "only show the part of the line that matches the pattern."
# -E enables extended regular expressions, which are more powerful than basic ones.
# The pattern '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' is a regular expression (regex) that matches IP addresses.

# Hereâ€™s how that pattern works:

# [0-9]{1,3}: This part matches numbers that are one to three digits long (for example, numbers between zero and nine hundred ninety-nine).
# \.: This matches a literal dot . between the number blocks in an IP address.
# {3}: This means the previous pattern (the number and dot) repeats three times. So, it matches three groups of numbers followed by dots.
# [0-9]{1,3}: Finally, it matches the last block of numbers without a dot.
# The overall pattern matches something like this: 192.168.0.1.

ipadd_pattern="([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}"
# macadd_pattern="([0-9][A-Z]{1,2}\:){5}[0-9][A-Z]{1,2}"
